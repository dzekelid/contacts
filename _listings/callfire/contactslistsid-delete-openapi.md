      summary: Create contact lists
      description: Creates a contact list for use with campaigns using 1 of 3 inputs.
        A List of Contact objects, a list of String E.164 numbers, or a list of CallFire
        contactIds can be used as the data source for the created contact list. After
        contact list is added into the CallFire system, contact lists goes through
        seven system safeguards that check the accuracy and consistency of the data.
        For example, our system checks that contact number is formatted correctly,
        is valid, is not duplicated in another contact list, or is not added on a
        specific DNC list. You can configure to keep/merge or remove contacts which
        do not complies these rules. If contacts were not added to a contact list
        after the validation, this means the data needs to be properly formatted and
        corrected before calling this API
