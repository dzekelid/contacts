        field_name:

        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name from your recipient.
        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.

      description: "**This endpoint allows you to create a segment.**\n\nAll recipients

        from an existing list\n* Don't send this in order to segment from your entire
        contactdb.\n\nValid operators for create and update depend on the type of
        the field you are segmenting: \n\n* **Dates:** \"eq\", \"ne\", \"lt\" (before),
        \"gt\" (after) \n* **Text:** \"contains\", \"eq\" (is - matches the full field),
        \"ne\" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition
        value) \n* **Numbers:** \"eq\", \"lt\", \"gt\" \n* **Email Clicks and Opens:**
        \"eq\" (opened), \"ne\" (not opened) \n\nSegment conditions using \"eq\" or
        \"ne\" for email clicks and opens should provide a \"field\" of either *clicks.campaign_identifier*
        or *opens.campaign_identifier*. The condition value should be a string containing
        the id of a completed campaign. \n\nSegments may contain multiple condtions,
        joined by an \"and\" or \"or\" in the \"and_or\" field. The first condition
        in the conditions list must have an empty \"and_or\", and subsequent conditions
